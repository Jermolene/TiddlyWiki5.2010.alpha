Planned improvements over the original TiddlyWiki

* Rich text editing, with toolbars and shortcuts (and hence native html and not wikitext)
* Graphics (SVG and image) as a first class citizen
* Richer tiddler model with revisions, mime types and integrated skinny tiddlers
* [[Social features|SocialTiddlyWiki]] that federate between servers and static files:
** #tag
** @user for referencing other users
** activity streams based on following users and tags
** impossibility of spam
* Microkernel architecture with integrated source code browsing and editing, with syntax colouring and hyperlinks
* Wide screen hungry, but concertinas to an iPhone
* Optimised for HTML5 browsers like Firefox 3, Safari 4, Chrome 2, Opera 10
* Degrades to IE6+
* Support for content stored in multiple locations/formats within the HTML file, including script tags, title tag, special comments (for MHTML), {{{<div>}}}'s like classic TiddlyWiki
* New architecture for encoding options as cookies or tiddlers or via custom handlers
