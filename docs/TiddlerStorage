Tiddlers are stored in a series of hashmaps by title, user and tag. The indexes are maintained over insertions and deletions.

Notification handlers can be registered which are automatically called after tiddlers matching a given selector have been created, modified or deleted. Notifications are issued asynchronously (using {{{setTimeout(0,fn)}}}). This means that if multiple tiddlers are modified then the notifications are deferred until all the modifications are completed.

One of the default notification handlers is the refresh mechanism which handles updates to macros by traversing the DOM.
