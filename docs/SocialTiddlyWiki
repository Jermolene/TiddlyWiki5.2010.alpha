The goal is to support a form of intellectual discourse where each writer seeks to build their own universe of understanding, with loose, one-way links to those of other individuals. This allows each individual to be the king of their own domain, in the sense that they can publish whatever they like, with no need to consult or worry about anyone else. And yet, they can make their contribution to the greater understanding of the group as a whole through the network of aggregated knowledge.
